## IMAGE IDENTIFICATION USING NEURAL NETWORKS AND KERAS

## Project Description
This project identifies the model of a car from an image.  A Convolutional Neural Network is trained on the Standard Cars Dataset.  Car images are vectorized and labels are created through one-hot encoding.  The model is built using Keras with a TensorFlow backend.

Unfortunately the dataset is too large to upload here in full.  Here is the link to the car image database.
